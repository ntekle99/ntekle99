# Hi 👋 I’m Noah Tekle

I’m a software engineer focused on **ML systems, performance-critical software, and distributed systems**. I’m currently completing a combined **B.S./M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering at USC**, with an emphasis on **systems and machine learning**.

## What I’m working on
- Building **production ML and data systems** (most recently at Adobe, supporting large-scale Databricks pipelines)
- Designing **high-performance systems** in C++ and CUDA
- Exploring **reinforcement learning and decision-making systems**

## Interests
- ML systems & infrastructure
- Distributed systems and networking
- Performance optimization (CUDA, concurrency, memory)
- Applied reinforcement learning

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, CUDA C  
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, Flask, React  
**Tools & Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks, PostgreSQL, Git  

## Selected Projects
- **Alpha Poker**  
  RL-driven poker platform using DQN and LSTM-based opponent modeling to adapt strategy in real time  
- **FastTransfer**  
  High-throughput UDP-based file transfer protocol achieving 15× throughput over SCP on lossy, high-latency networks  
- **Distributed Key-Value Store**  
  Redis-inspired KV store with asynchronous replication and sub-millisecond P99 write latency  
- **GPU-Accelerated Image Processing**  
  Custom CUDA kernels with shared-memory tiling achieving 10× speedup over CPU implementations  

## Experience Highlights
- **Adobe** — Built distributed data migration services processing ~10M rows/min into Databricks  
- **Apple** — Applied ML research; co-authored ACM paper with 40% recommendation accuracy improvement  
- **Southern California Edison** — Automated failure detection systems reducing response times by 25%
